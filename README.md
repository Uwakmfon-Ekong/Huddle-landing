Overview
The challenge
Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Screenshot


Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like FireShot to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.

What I learned
I've learnt how to successfully work with icons and also link them to my social media pages

.circle:hover{
    border: 1px solid hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
    cursor: pointer;
}
Continued development
I want to be better in making flex boxes and grids and also giving accurate widths .

Useful resources
Example resource 1 - This helped when i forgot the cursor property to call pointer. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
